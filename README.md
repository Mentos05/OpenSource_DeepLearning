# Deep Learning with Open Source
Private repository with personal work on deep learning topics with Open Source software

### About the Author
Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!<br>

I am Michael Gorkow, a German Data Scientist living in the beautiful city of Munich.<br>
My general focus area is advanced analytics but my passion really lies in applying state-of-the-art deep learning on complex problems.<br>
In the last couple of years I've been working a lot with deep learning and from time to time I create demonstrations that show how complex problems with unstructured data can be tackled.<br>
